## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Only `DataMessage` that are sent, received, or sent from another device are saved in the local store (#137).
  This is a breaking change because clients previously had to introduce calls to filter internal messages themselves.

- Changed (and fixed) the behaviour of the iterator returned by `SledStore::messages` (#119)
  * The iterator yields elements in chronological order (used to be reversed)
  * The iterator now implements `DoubleEndedIterator` which means you it can be reversed or consumed from the end
  * The method now accepts the full range syntax, like `0..=1678295210` or `..` for all messages
